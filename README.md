**To analyse and interpret survival data using suitable survival technique and to explore the use of machine learning algorithms in time to event data.**
Survival analysis is concerned with studying the time between entry to a study and a Subsequent event. Originally the analysis was concerned with time from treatment until death, hence the name, but survival analysis is applicable to many areas as well as mortality. The popular survival methods include Kaplan Meier, Nelson Aalen, Log Rank, Cox Proportional Hazard Model, and so on. This project deals about analyzing the dataset containing cardiovascular medical records taken from 299 patients. All patients in the cohort were diagnosed with the systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle and had previous history of heart failures.
